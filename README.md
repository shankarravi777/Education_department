This code creates a Flask application that retrieves data from an SQLite database and displays it in an HTML table using a Jinja2 template.

When a user navigates to the root URL ('/'), the Table() function is called. Inside this function, the code establishes a connection to the education_department_data.db SQLite database and sets the row factory to sqlite3.Row. This allows the results of the query to be treated as dictionaries, which can be easily used in a Jinja2 template.

The code then executes a SQL query that joins two tables, table1 and table2, on their Transaction_Number fields. The query selects five fields: Transaction_Number, Departmental_Family, Date, Supplier, and Amount.

After executing the query, the code retrieves all of the rows returned by the query using the fetchall() method. It then closes the database connection.

Finally, the Table() function returns a rendered Jinja2 template called tables.html. The rows variable is passed as a parameter to the template, allowing it to display the data in an HTML table.
